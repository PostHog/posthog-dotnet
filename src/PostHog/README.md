# PostHog .NET SDK

This is a client SDK for the PostHog API written in C#. This is the core implementation of PostHog.

## Goals

The goal of this package is to be usable in multiple .NET environments. At this moment, we are far short of that goal. We only support ASP.NET Core via [PostHog.AspNetCore](../PostHog.AspNetCore/README.md).
