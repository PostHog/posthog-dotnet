## Goals

The goal of this package is to be usable in multiple .NET environments. At this moment, we are far short of that goal. We only support ASP.NET Core via [PostHog.AspNetCore](../PostHog.AspNetCore/README.md).

## Usage

To use this package, you need to create an instance of `PostHogClient` and call the appropriate methods. Here's an example:

```csharp
using PostHog;

var client = new PostHogClient(new PostHogOptions { ProjectApiKey = "YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY" });
await client.CaptureAsync("user-123", "Test Event");
```
