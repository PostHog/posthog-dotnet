# PostHog.AspNetCore

This is a client SDK for the PostHog API written in C#. This package depends on the PostHog package and provides 
additional functionality for ASP.NET Core projects.

> [!WARNING]  
> This package is currently in a pre-release stage. We're making it available publicly to solicit
> feedback. While we always strive to maintain a high level of quality, use this package at your own
> risk. There *will* be many breaking changes until we reach a stable release.

## Installation

Use the `dotnet` CLI to add the package to your project:

```bash
$ dotnet add package PostHog.AspNetCore
```

## Configuration

Register your PostHog instance in `Program.cs` (or `Startup.cs` depending on how you roll):

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddPostHog();
```

Set your project API key using user secrets:

```bash
$ dotnet user-secrets set PostHog:ProjectApiKey YOUR_API_KEY
```

In most cases, that's all you need to configure!

If you're using the EU hosted instance of PostHog or a self-hosted instance, you can configure the `HostUrl` setting in 
`appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "PostHog": {
    "HostUrl": "https://eu.i.posthog.com"
  }
}
```

There are some more settings you can configure if you want to tweak the behavior of the client, but the defaults 
should work in most cases.

The available options are:

| Option          | Description                                                       | Default                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `HostUrl`       | The URL of the PostHog instance.                                  | https://us.i.posthog.com |
| `MaxBatchSize`  | The maximum number of events to send in a single batch.           | `100`                    |
| `MaxQueueSize`  | The maximum number of events to store in the queue at any time.   | `1000`                   |
| `FlushAt`       | The number of events to enqueue before sending events to PostHog. | `20`                     |
| `FlushInterval` | The interval in milliseconds between periodic flushes.            | `30` seconds             |

> [!NOTE]
> The client will attempt to send events to PostHog in the background. It sends it every `FlushInterval` or when 
> `FlushAt` events have been enqueued. However, if the network is down or if there's a spike in events, the queue 
> could grow without restriction. The `MaxQueueSize` setting is there to prevent the queue from growing too large. 
> When that number is reached, the client will start dropping older events. `MaxBatchSize` ensures that the `/batch` 
> request doesn't get too large.

## Usage

Inject the `IPostHogClient` interface into your controller or page:

```csharp
public class HomeController(IPostHogClient posthogClient) : Controller
{
    public IActionResult SignUpComplete()
    {
        var userId = User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
        posthogClient.CaptureEvent(userId, "user signed up", new() { ["plan"] = "pro" });
        return View();
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class IndexModel(IPostHogClient client) : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet()
    {
        var userId = User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
        client.CapturePageView(userId, Request.Path.Value ?? "Unknown");
    }
}
```

### Identity

#### Identify a user

See the [Identifying users](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/identify) for more information about identifying users.

Identifying a user typically happens on the front-end. For example, when an authenticated user logs in, you can call `identify` to associate the user with their previously anonymous actions.

When `identify` is called the first-time for a distinct id, PostHog will create a new user profile. If the user already exists, PostHog will update the user profile with the new data. So the typical usage of `IdentifyAsync` here will be to update the person properties that PostHog knows about your user.

```csharp
await posthogClient.IdentifyAsync(
    userId,
    new() 
    {
        ["email"] = "haacked@posthog.com",
        ["name"] = "Phil Haack",
        ["plan"] = "pro"
    });
```

#### Alias a user

Use the `Alias` method to associate one identity with another. This is useful when a user logs in and you want to associate their anonymous actions with their authenticated actions.

```csharp
var sessionId = Request.Cookies["session_id"]; // Used for anonymous actions.
var userId = User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value; // Now we know who they are.
await posthogClient.AliasAsync(sessionId, userId);
```

### Analytics

#### Capture an Event

Note that capturing events is designed to be fast and done in the background. You can configure how often batches are sent to the PostHog API using the `FlushAt` and `FlushInterval` settings.

```csharp
posthogClient.CaptureEvent(userId, "user signed up", new() { ["plan"] = "pro" });
```

#### Capture a Page View

```csharp
posthogClient.CapturePageView(userId, Request.Path.Value ?? "Unknown");
```

#### Capture a Screen View

```csharp
posthogClient.CaptureScreen(userId, "Main Screen");
```

### Feature Flags

#### Check if feature flag is enabled

Check if the `awesome-new-feature` feature flag is enabled for the user with the id `userId`.

```csharp
var enabled = await posthogClient.IsFeatureEnabledAsync(userId, "awesome-new-feature");
```

### Get a single Feature Flag

Some feature flags may have associated payloads.

```csharp
if (await posthogClient.GetFeatureFlagAsync(userId, "awesome-new-feature") is { Payload: {} payload })
{
    // Do something with the payload.
    Console.WriteLine($"The payload is: {payload}");
}
```

### Get All Feature Flags

```csharp
var flags = await posthogClient.GetFeatureFlagsAsync(userId);
```
